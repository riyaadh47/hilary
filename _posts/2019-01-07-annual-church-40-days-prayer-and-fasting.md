**The church 21 days fasting and prayers is an annual program that the whole church members participates in order to start the year in the presence of God. Our Senior Pastor Jeff Onyems started this initiative as a way of breaking any strongholds in the lives of the church members in any new year. This year 2020, the fasting was started on the 6th of January 2020 and will last for the duration of 21 days. During these 21 days of fasting the church will be opened for prayers around 10:00 am in the morning, 12 noon and 6pm daily. At 6pm daily every member of the church is expected to come and break the fast with an hour of spirit led prayers which is led by the Senior pastor or any of his assistant pastors.**

**Every member is required to bring a bottle of water and olive oil for blessings, which they will take home after the conclusion of the 21 days fasting. Join us while the fasting is still going, to receive your breakthrough in all your endeavors. See you there.**
