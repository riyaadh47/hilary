The church 40 days fasting and prayers is an annual program that the whole church members participates in order to start the year in the presence of God. Our Senior Pastor Jeff Onyems started this initiative as a way of breaking any strongholds in the lives of the church members in any new year. This year 2019, the fasting was started on the 7th of January 2019 and will last for the duration of 40 days. During these 40 days of fasting the church will be opened for prayers around 10:00 am in the morning, 12 noon and 6pm daily. At 6pm daily every member of the church is expected to come and break the fast with an hour of spirit led prayers which is led by the Senior pastor or any of his assistant pastors. <br/>  Every member is required to bring a bottle of water and olive oil for blessings, which they will take home after the conclusion of the 40 days fasting. Join us while the fasting is still going on to receive your breakthrough in all your endeavors. See you there.
