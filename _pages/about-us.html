description: 'House of Worship Ministry commenced with their first church service
  on the 21st of July 2013 at No. 7 Loop Street, Cape Town with General Overseer Pastor
  Jeff Onyems and his wife. God added to their number and in April 2014 the church
  moved to her second location at 8 Rochester Street Observatory with 9 dedicated
  members. Ever since then God has worked mightily through the General Overseer Pastor
  Jeff Onyems as lots of miracles happened. More souls has been added consistently
  over the years which led to the relocation of the church to a new church premises
  at No. 48 Hopkins Street Salt River Cape Town on 19th December 2014. At the church
  premises in Salt River great multitudes joined the ministry within 3 to 4 years
  through the prophetic anointing of the Man of God Pastor Jeff Onyems and his assistants.
  The ministry rose to over 100 dedicated members and this meant that a new church
  premises with a larger venue was needed to accommodate the growing number of church
  members. God through one of the church members made the vision possible as he helped
  facilitate the new and current venue of the church which is 19 Spencer Road Salt
  River Cape Town South Africa. The church oficially moved into the new premises on
  the 28th March 2018 and the first Sunday service was held on the 1st of April 2018.  '
